# Support and Help

Welcome to Weburz! We're here to provide you with the support you need to have a positive experience in our community.

## Getting Help

If you encounter any issues, have questions, or need assistance, there are several ways you can get help:

### 1. Community Discussions

Visit our [Community Discussions](https://github.com/weburz/discussions) to engage with other community members, share your experiences, and ask for help. This is a great place to collaborate and learn from others.

### 2. GitHub Issues

If you're experiencing a bug, have a feature request, or need technical help, you can open an issue on the relevant repository. Please follow these guidelines when opening an issue:

- **Search First**: Before opening a new issue, search the existing issues to see if someone has already reported a similar problem or question.

- **Provide Details**: When opening an issue, provide as much relevant information as possible. This might include a clear description of the problem, steps to reproduce it, error messages, and your environment details.

### 3. Contact Weburz
